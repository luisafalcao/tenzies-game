# The Project
This project was first created during the Scrimba React course, and later on I included more functionalities on my own and also made changes to the design.

## Added Functionalities
* Scoreboard: the scoreboard shos the the current record and the last game's score (both saved via localStorage).
* Number of rolls: this is how the score is calculated.
